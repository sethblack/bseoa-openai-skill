# Black SEO Analyzer — OpenAI Skill

An OpenAI Codex skill (`$bseoa`) for working with [Black SEO Analyzer](https://github.com/sethblack/black-seo-analyzer), a Rust-based CLI tool for comprehensive technical SEO analysis.

## What This Skill Does

When you type `$bseoa` in Codex, Codex becomes an expert assistant for BSEOA. It will:

- Build correct commands for your specific analysis goal
- Run BSEOA and capture results
- Interpret crawl data and explain what issues mean
- Prioritize findings by SEO impact
- Suggest command flags for follow-up analysis

## Installation

### Windows

```bat
install.bat
```

Or manually copy the `bseoa` directory to:
```
%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\bseoa\
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r bseoa ~/.agents/skills/bseoa
```

After installing, restart Codex (or open a new session) for the skill to appear.

## Usage

In any Codex session, invoke explicitly with:

```
$bseoa
```

Or let Codex pick it up implicitly when your prompt involves SEO audits, crawling, or BSEOA analysis.

Examples:

```
$bseoa
Analyze https://example.com and give me a full SEO audit as JSON.
```

```
$bseoa
I want to find all broken links on my site at https://mysite.com
```

```
$bseoa
Run a quick audit on https://example.com using OpenAI for content suggestions
```

```
$bseoa
Re-generate a CSV report from the last crawl without re-crawling
```

## Skill Location

Codex reads skills from `~/.agents/skills/` (user scope) and `.agents/skills/` relative to your repository or working directory (repo scope). This skill installs to the user scope so it is available in any project.

## Requirements

- [Black SEO Analyzer](https://github.com/sethblack/black-seo-analyzer) installed and on your PATH
- Codex CLI, IDE extension, or Codex app
- (Optional) A BSEOA license key for unlimited page analysis
- (Optional) API keys for AI-powered analysis (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, or Gemini)

## Skill File

The skill logic lives in `bseoa/SKILL.md`. Reference files are in `bseoa/reference/` and `bseoa/license.md`. The optional `bseoa/agents/openai.yaml` configures Codex app metadata and invocation policy. Edit these to customize behavior, add site-specific defaults, or tune guidance for your workflow.
